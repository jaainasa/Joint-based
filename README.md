# Joint-based
Joint-based Descriptor is a novel description for protein structure using joints of secondary structures as a basic element. It shows how the joint-based descriptor can be applied to examine the conformational features of transmembrane (TM) proteins. 
1. Preprogram thought is the program access any PDB structures and calculated the dihedral angles for the mentioned joint points. 
2. Specify the chain and joint points of the protein structure to which the dihedral angle should  be calculated. 
3. Assign a output name.
4. Parse the structure(PDB) and get the output dihedral angles in degrees.
